# Hastable notes

- Unordered map => O(1) => insertion, search and delete
- Ordered map => O(log n) => insertion, search and delete
 
 
 # Bucket sort
 
 - Vector of arrays i.e., vector<int> arr[5]
 
 # Priority Queue
 
 - Write comparator overloading bool operator, where a>b is min heap and a<b is max heap.
 - Default behavior for PQ is max heap, using std::greater can invert the behavior
